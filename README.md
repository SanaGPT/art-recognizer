Title: Art Recognizer: Classifying Artistic Styles with Neural Networks

Overview:
This project trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify paintings by artistic style (e.g., Impressionism, Cubism, Renaissance). It explores how computer vision can capture subjective features of human creativity.

Pipeline :
Data preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation)

CNN training on labeled art datasets

Evaluation with confusion matrix and top-1 accuracy

Results :
Achieved 85% accuracy on a held-out test set.
